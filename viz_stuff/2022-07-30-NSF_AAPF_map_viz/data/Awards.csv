He will study very light, very penetrating subatomic particles called neutrinos. In particular, his work will involve designing and implementing searches for ultra-high energy (UHE) neutrinos by detecting the faint radio signal produced when a neutrino interacts with the Earth. He will develop techniques for extracting important information from detected neutrinos, such as their energy, the direction in the universe they came from, and the type of neutrino, called neutrino flavor. He will work with existing neutrino detectors at the South Pole and help to develop a future larger Radio Neutrino Observatory. Alongside this research, he will mentor undergraduate students who are involved in a summer research program. He will supervise research projects related to his work and will guide the students in their professional development. <br/><br/>The project, if successful, will yield the detection of Ultra-High Energy (UHE) neutrinos, which, like gravitational waves, are probes of processes hidden to electromagnetic radiation, and it would thus advance the goals of the NSF Windows on the Universe Big Idea.  The proposed scientific program will generate the world's most sensitive search for a diffuse flux of neutrinos with energies above 100 PeV, and potentially lead to the first observation of UHE neutrinos. Energy reconstruction will allow a precise measurement of the flux of UHE neutrinos and determine their overall spectrum. Direction reconstruction will enable a search for point sources, and flavor determination will make possible tests of neutrino oscillations on cosmic-scale baselines.

Studying the CMZ is important, because it provides a rare glimpse of how gas is converted into stars under the hot, dense, and turbulent conditions present near the center of the Galaxy. Because most stars in the early universe are thought to have formed under extreme conditions similar to those found in the CMZ, the proposed studies would enable a better understanding of star formation in the early universe.

With the SMA, Battersby is leading the first wide-field subparsec survey of the CMZ, which will: (1) yield a comprehensive census of dense cores in the CMZ; (2) compare their basic properties with star-forming clouds in the Galactic disk; and (3) determine if star formation in the CMZ is consistent with a hypothesized critical density or universal relationship for star formation.

Models also show that rotational mixing causes significant abundance changes at the stellar surface, especially among He and the CNO elements, well before the convective zone deepens during the red supergiant phase. However, the rotating stellar models are not yet fully constrained, and observational evidence of such abundance changes is limited.

The goal of the research is to detect evidence of the first stars, thought to be born sometime about 500 Million years after the Big Bang. These stars emitted intense radiation which burned away the universe's pervasive atmosphere of Hydrogen. As hydrogen accounts for three quarters of the normal matter in the universe, this last global cosmological process underpins much of what is known about cosmology and galaxy formation. However, observing this time period in ordinary star light challenges the world's premier telescopes due to the extreme distance and faintness of the early stars. The goal of this research program is to detect and characterize radio emission from intergalactic hydrogen before and during its ionization using two recently completed radio telescopes. Detecting and characterizing the predicted radio signature of this ""Cosmic Dawn"" was rated as a top priority by the astronomical community. This project will also support a student volunteer corps who will take a portable a planetarium to schools and who will be directly involved in developing elements for museum and planetarium facilities. These include a state of the art 3D planetarium theater, in the recently constructed Arizona State University astronomy building.<br/><br/>Recent advances in digital technology allow the construction of very large arrays of antennae which provide the necessary sensitivity to detect radio emission from Hydrogen when the universe was only 300Mya old. Emitted at a wavelength of 21cm, the radiation is stretched by cosmological expansion to an observed wavelength of 1.5 to 3m depending on the time period under observation. Both the Murchison Widefield Array (MWA) and the Precision Array for Probing the Epoch of Reionization (PAPER) have been designed to observe these wavelengths at the necessary sensitivity and are constructed, in large part with funding from the National Science Foundation, far from interfering human radio emission; the MWA is in Western Australia and PAPER is in the Karoo desert of South Africa. Using both telescopes, Dr. Jacobs will compile a deep statistical measure of the amount of radiation coming from Hydrogen in the early universe. Portions of the work include performing observations, measuring and removing other bright interfering signals from other bright astronomical objects, and applying this new knowledge to building larger telescopes capable of directly imaging the early universe. These measurements of bright interfering signals will form a substantial, interesting, and compellingly beautiful image of the universe and provide a foundation data set for exhibits produced by the student corps created as a part of the project. The team of undergraduate students will have two goals: First to improve retention of astronomy and science education undergraduates and second to bring planetarium shows to traditionally underserved schools and tribal centers which cannot take advantage of other, more costly, programs."

Weber will also develop a science communication program for University of Chicago students.<br/>     <br/>Weber will study the generation and emergence of magnetism in fully convective M dwarfs and in those with an imposed tachocline.   She will produce the first set of simulations that address dynamo action and the rotation-activity correlation for M dwarfs across the partially-to-fully convective transition. The nature of the magnetism generated will inform separate simulations of flux emergence and allow astronomers to interpret observations of M dwarf magnetic activity.  Her work will assess whether buoyant magnetic structures emerge self-consistently in these stars, as they are in rapidly rotating Sun-like stars.  Comparing such structures with those studied through traditional flux emergence models will allow a better understanding of the flux pattern expected at the stellar surface.

Barron will work on the expansion of the NSF-funded POLARBEAR project, which is mapping the cosmic microwave background (CMB) from its site in the Atacama desert in Chile. The CMB is the first light from our primordial universe, generated by the thermal glow from the Big Bang. Measurements of the CMB have been essential to our current understanding of the universe's formation, but there is still more to discover with detailed measurements of its polarization properties. The CMB field has reached an important milestone with several experiments, including POLARBEAR, making detections of a unique polarization pattern resulting from gravitational distortions. This signal is so faint that these detections required years-long ""exposures"" of a small patch of sky. Making detailed maps of this signal across the sky will enable significant advances in our understanding of the structure of our universe and its origins. Alongside this work, Barron will run an outreach program focused on cultivating basic research skills and interest in STEM with high school and community college students. <br/><br/>The POLARBEAR project is expanding from one telescope observing at a single wavelength, to an array of three 3.5 meter telescopes with larger, broader bandwidth cameras. This expansion will enable a detailed survey of microwave polarization across 65% of the sky, at three different wavelengths. Barron will focus on development and observations with the new camera that will be sensitive to both the peak CMB wavelength and a shorter wavelength where Galactic emission can overwhelm the CMB signal. These simultaneous measurements will be used to monitor the Galactic contamination in the survey areas, so that the underlying primordial CMB polarization signal can be extracted. This camera will be developed and characterized at UC Berkeley before being deployed to the Chilean site. The cameras for these microwave telescopes involve complex cryogenic and electronic systems, reading out large numbers of sensitive superconducting detectors, kept at a temperature of 0.25 Kelvin. Students in the outreach program will get hands-on experience with software and hardware development through self-directed radio astronomy projects, applying the same fundamentals that go into the development of the POLARBEAR cameras."

Outside the Galactic disk, where most stars including our Sun reside, most of our Galaxy's mass is in its roughly spherical halo of dark matter, invisible material only known to exist through its gravitational influence. Also out there are a handful of halo stars, including the scattered remains of smaller galaxies that entered the Milky Way's dark halo only to be ripped apart by its tidal forces. The structures left behind, called tidal streams, can be used to study the distribution of the Milky Way's dark matter. Each tidal stream is made up of stars that were once neighbors in the same small galaxy, and thus now follow similar paths as they orbit the Milky Way. This common origin gives us insight into the Galaxy's mass distribution, which determines the orbits of the stream's stars: only if we guess close to the true mass distribution do the computed orbits of stars in each stream cluster together around a common progenitor. Changes to the neighboring orbits of tidal stream stars could also provide evidence for smaller-scale dark matter structure: tiny dark matter clumps too small to hold galaxies, predicted by some theories of dark matter, would deflect the paths of stream stars in predictable ways. Dr. Sanderson will develop new tools to explore the structure of dark matter halos, particularly the Milky Way's, by studying their tidal streams. These tools use state-of-the-art methods, yet are based on fundamental concepts that kids learn in middle school: why stars shine, how we make and read maps, and how gravity works. To teach these core ideas and inspire middle schoolers' interest in science, Dr. Sanderson will develop portable science lessons for use in underserved New York City middle schools. The modules will use songs and movement the students produce themselves to introduce them to the ""music of the spheres.""<br/><br/>The work Dr. Sanderson will carry out as a fellow has three goals. First, she will expand a new method of inferring the Milky Way's mass distribution, which uses concepts borrowed from information theory to statistically analyze the clustering of halo stars in streams and thereby select the best fit for the Milky Way halo. This method will be applied to forthcoming data from the Gaia satellite, which will accurately measure complete positions and velocities for millions of stream stars in the Milky Way. Second, she will study the influence of small dark matter clumps on tidal streams, by predicting their effects on the orbits of the stream stars and determining which effects would be most diagnostic to observe. Finally, Dr. Sanderson will complete tests of a new tool to estimate the masses of galaxies outside our Milky Way, based on observations of a particular type of tidal stream known as a shell or umbrella. In these special cases we can understand the stream stars' orbits, and hence the mass of the host galaxy, even with only the limited information we can obtain for such distant stars. The information from these new strategies will allow Dr. Sanderson to compare the structures of galaxy halos, including our Milky Way's, to predictions based on different theories of dark matter. The images, movies, and computer simulations produced in her work will be incorporated into the middle school science lessons she will develop, to help educate and inspire a new generation of American scientists."

This project involves observations to understand the formation of the first galaxies in the Universe.  This period of cosmic history, called the Epoch of Reionization (EoR), occurred when emission from the first galaxies fed back into the intergalactic medium (IGM) and ionized it.  The Fellow is a developer of the NSF-funded Precision Array for Probing the Epoch of Reionization (PAPER), an experiment to detect a radio signal from the EoR.  Ultimately, measurements of 21cm radio emission from both the EoR and other epochs offer a unique, 3-dimensional cosmic probe with the potential to revolutionize our understanding of cosmology as the cosmic microwave background has done in the past two decades.<br/><br/>Experiments like PAPER have been limited so far by the intrinsic faintness of the cosmological 21cm signal, and the presence of significantly brighter astrophysical foreground emission.  This project will benefit from recent developments in infrastructure and data analysis to overcome these obstacles, and it may offer the first meaningful constraints on the nature of the galaxies responsible for reionization to come from observations of the 21cm line.  Because the first generation of results from PAPER will be low signal-to-noise, the Fellow will support his principal analysis with a campaign to investigate systematic effects in 21cm EoR experiments to maximize the scientific impact of these measurements.  His collaboration with sponsoring scientist Miguel Morales at the University of Washington will provide access to data from the Murchison Widefield Array (MWA), another array targeting a detection of the EoR signal. <br/><br/>The broader impacts of this project include a significant educational component.

GASE is currently being commissioned by a team of community college transfer students, recruited and trained as part of an NSF CAREER award (AST-0847753).  These students begin working on GASE prior to transferring, and as a result, they develop a network of support and mentoring relationships to help fight against ""transfer shock"" and increase their retention rate.  The fellow will take over direction of the GASE project and be the principal supervisor for these students.  He will also lead them to develop the GASE system, including a new correlator to enable continuous observations.  The fellow's ultimate vision for the project is for GASE to be deployable at multiple institutions and for it to be a hands-on, education-focused interferometer that until recently was beyond the reach of most undergraduate physics and astronomy departments."

One of the greatest unresolved puzzles of our Milky Way Galaxy (MW) is the nature of the long central bar: its structure, dynamics, and stellar chemical composition.  The bar is expected to have a significant impact on mass and abundance distributions in the inner Galaxy, which are used to characterize the MW's global properties and their relation to those of other galaxies.  This characterization is crucial for understanding not only the MW but also general galactic evolution because the proximity and accessibility of the MW makes it the most powerful resource that investigators have to develop models of galaxy formation and aging.  Unfortunately, a thorough understanding of the MW's fundamental properties has been precluded as its inner regions, where most of the stellar mass is located, are behind the thick dust of the midplane.  New infrared (IR) data from multiple photometric and spectroscopic surveys are providing a way to probe these inner regions at a level never before possible.  The fellow plans a comprehensive analysis of the inner MW that focuses on the spatial, dynamical, and chemical properties of the influential but poorly-understood long bar.  This project will take advantage of the unprecedented availability of both photometric and spectroscopic infrared observations of the inner MW midplane, including unique high resolution IR spectra from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey III's Apache Point Observatory Galactic Evolution Experiment (APOGEE).<br/><br/>The fellow will combine near- and mid-IR photometry to produce an extinction-corrected catalogue of stars spanning the long bar and outer bulge, and she will use this catalogue to make the first stellar density map of these regions that is capable of measuring the long bar's position, axial ratios, and structural coherence.  She will collect radial velocities with APOGEE for a large sample of red clump (RC) giants in the long bar and compare them to kinematical predictions from N-body and stellar dynamics models to measure the bar's systematic velocity, dispersion, and dynamical coherence.  Of particular interest are the kinematics of the ""transition regions"" where resonances influence the bar-bulge and bar-disk relationships.  Finally, the fellow will use the APOGEE-derived metallicities and abundances of the RC sample to measure the metallicity distribution along the bar, including the presence of multiple stellar populations.  The result will be a complete picture of the long bar's spatial, dynamical, and chemical distributions, which can be used to establish the bar's properties compared to external galactic bars, along with its stellar properties and mixing efficiency.<br/><br/>The broader impacts of this project include a significant educational component.  The fellow will leverage OSU's partnership with Ohio's 4-H program to demonstrate to children and the general public that science and scientific inquiry are fun, relevant to their lives, and perhaps most importantly, accessible to all.  In partnership with the Ohio 4-H state office, the fellow will contribute to two projects teaching scientific concepts through interactive activities, with an emphasis on those that can be easily done in the home.  First, she will develop astronomy-themed activities for an annual summer Space Camp targeted at middle-school students.  Second, she will combine astronomy-themed activities with suitable background information and evaluation metrics into a Space Science Project Book for 4-H's Project Book series, which encourages students to select, design, and evaluate their own learning experiences beyond the classroom.  The close association of 4-H with rural and often economically disadvantaged schools means that the materials that she develops will impact the scientific literacy of these underserved communities."

The fellow will investigate signatures of inflation in the polarization of the Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB), the afterglow light from the big bang. Cosmic inflation is a theorized period of rapid expansion in the earliest moments of the universe. It generates features in the polarization of the CMB that are contaminated by other polarization sources. To accurately measure these features and learn more about inflation, these other sources of polarization must be well-characterized and removed from the observations. Mr. Henning will develop techniques for characterizing contaminants, and will also contribute to design and testing efforts to construct a new camera designed specifically to measure CMB polarization with high resolution and fidelity. Furthermore, to demonstrate that research is an exciting and engaging enterprise, Mr. Henning will design new content for several outreach venues providing an insider's look into scientific research. Through interactive displays, live talks, and real-time social media, he will provide access to how research takes place while it's happening.<br/><br/>Primordial B-modes are expected to be imprinted in the CMB by gravitational waves generated during inflation. This primordial signal, however, is contaminated by lensing B-modes difficult to measure and remove by low-resolution experiments. Mr. Henning will focus attention on two high-resolution CMB polarization experiments probing primordial B-modes in order to constrain inflation. He will lead a campaign of detector characterization and design efforts for the upcoming SPT-3G experiment. He will also extend and develop techniques to analyze datasets from the SPT-POL and SPT-3G experiments at large angular scales, which will include methods for polarized foreground removal and de-lensing in particular, a unique ability made possible by high-resolution experiments. For outreach education, Mr. Henning will expand several successful programs by generating new content with the goal of providing a window into research. He will contribute to new Adler Planetarium exhibits about microwave detection technologies and the South Pole Telescope and lead audiences through them during live Astronomy Conversations. He will also integrate SPT data into the WorldWide Telescope and create a guided tour of data analysis. Finally, Mr. Henning will organize and generate content for several social media outlets to relay the everyday activities of current research to the public in real-time."

The red-sequence galaxies (RSGs) generally have elliptical or spheroidal morphologies, have little or no neutral interstellar medium (ISM), and are not actively forming stars. RSGs tend to be more massive than the star-forming spiral galaxies that constitute the blue cloud. A crucial step to making massive, ""red and dead"" elliptical galaxies is to halt star formation, which allows the galaxies to evolve onto the red sequence.

Over the past decade it has become increasingly clear that supermassive black holes (BHs) play a pivotal role in galaxy evolution. This revelation has been driven by the discovery that most, if not all, galaxies harbor a BH, and that the mass of the BH is related to the global properties of the host galaxy, likely as a consequence of the co-evolution of galaxies and their BHs. It is widely accepted that BHs accumulate mass through accretion of material from the host galaxy and that this process is the source of power behind active galactic nuclei (AGN). The massive BHs found in elliptical galaxies are understood to be products of intense quasar AGN activity occurring in the early universe as a result of major galaxy mergers. In contrast, the ongoing BH growth in the local universe occurs primarily in spiral galaxies hosting Seyfert AGN, the driving mechanism(s) of which are not yet known. Despite the significant BH growth occurring in these galaxies, there is no observed correlation of this activity with large-scale phenomena (>100 pc); this indicates that the triggering mechanism of this mode of accretion, and thus its role in galaxy evolution, is hidden on smaller scales. Dr Hicks will conduct the first comparative study of the two-dimensional molecular gas kinematics, as well as stellar kinematics, on scales down to 10 pc in a matched sample of Seyfert and inactive galaxies. Dr. Hicks will interpret the observed kinematic signatures of gas inflow in the context of theoretical models, and will thereby constrain the mechanism(s) responsible for BH growth in the local universe.<br/><br/>Dr. Hicks will also lead two educational activities at UW that aim to excite a diverse population of undergraduate students about the field of astronomy and to encourage these students to pursue astronomy as a career. As a participant in the well-established UW Pre-Major in Astronomy Program (Pre-MAP), which recruits incoming students from groups that are traditionally underrepresented in science and promotes astronomy as an undergraduate major, Dr. Hicks will provide entry level research projects drawn from the proposed galaxy evolution research as well as one-on-one student mentoring throughout the yearlong program. Dr. Hicks will also help to spread the success of Pre-MAP to other STEM departments across UW. A partnership will be formed with the recently created, NSF-funded Pacific Northwest Louis Stokes Alliance for Minority Participation (PNW LSAMP) to assist with the implementation of similar programs in other Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics (STEM) departments across UW. This will include collaboration on new programs in curriculum building, funding acquisition and research project development, and will work toward the PNW LSAMP five-year goal of doubling the number of underrepresented minority students graduating in STEM fields. <br/><br/>Dr. Hicks's second educational activity will be a course entitled ""Galaxies: From Black Holes to Superclusters,"" to be developed and taught within the UW astronomy department. This course will draw directly from Dr. Hicks's research activities and related topics, and will provide the opportunity to share the fascination of extragalactic research with non-science majors.

Hamden is awarded an NSF Astronomy and Astrophysics Postdoctoral Fellowship to carry out a program of research and education at the California Institute of Technology. Our current understanding the formation of galaxies has thus far relied on our ability to directly detect light from the stars of those galaxies. But directly observing galaxies isn't enough to tell us exactly how a particular galaxy has formed or why one galaxy differs from another. According to high-resolution computer simulations, there should be large reservoirs of gas and dust outside of galaxies, providing new inflowing material and feeding star formation. This inflowing material is combined with hot gas blown off by explosive events in the galaxy itself, such as exploding stars. This gas, surrounding and feeding the galaxy, is known as the Circumgalactic Medium (CGM), and is extremely dim. The CGM has only been observed indirectly, by looking at what the gas does to light from a more distant object, which cannot create a full picture of the gas. The PI will observe this gas directly for the first time by taking advantage of new instruments. Direct detection of the CGM gas will help determine how the types of galaxies observed today were formed. The PI will also work within the community of public schools around Caltech to create a program that teaches public school science teachers about astronomy and telescope use and that gives them the tools to start astronomy classes and clubs at their schools. These classes will then work on a small project building their own instrumentation that can be used to take data.<br/> <br/>This project will directly detect the CGM for the first time using newly built and proposed IFUs to observe x, y, velocity, temperature, and metallicity information. The observing program will incorporate existing absorption line studies to select galaxies with known MgII absorption. The outer regions and halos of these galaxies should have bright metal emission lines in the Keck Cosmic Web Imager (KCWI) redshift range. Hamden will also use KCWI, and the Cosmic Web Imager (CWI) on Palomar, to detect redshifted emission lines from galaxies observed by the Faint Intergalactic Redshifted Balloon (FIREBall, a forthcoming UV multi-object spectrograph, attempting to detect the CGM at UV wavelengths). Maps of UV emission from FIREBall can be paired with maps of other metal lines from KCWI and CWI to provide temperature diagnostics, density measurements, and velocity information for a galaxy halo. Accurate sky background subtraction is the key to observing the CGM in emission and determining the conditions and history of galaxy growth."

From the moment the first star ended its life in a catastrophic supernova explosion, elements heavier than hydrogen and helium have been ""polluting"" the once pristine gas left over from the Big Bang. Understanding the nature of this evolution from a simple universe containing only hydrogen and helium to the one we know today, rich with the elements that have become the building blocks of life, is of great interest to the astrophysics community. However, accurately modeling and understanding this process has proven difficult. The research program to be carried out by Dr. Silvia is aimed at solving one particular mystery: why does some of the matter in the Universe appear to go missing as a function of cosmic time? While observational astronomers have endeavored to locate this matter using the powerful Hubble Space Telescope (HST), much of it continues to elude detection. Dr. Silvia will employ state-of-art cosmological simulations capable of accurately tracking the matter contained in the Universe and calculating its physical properties. By using the results of these simulations to produce synthetic observations that mimic those captured by the HST, Dr. Silvia will be able to answer the question: where is the missing matter is hiding? Alongside this research program, Dr. Silvia is driven to address the apparent lack of diversity within STEM disciplines by developing and teaching a new astronomy course that will leverage innovative educational practices shown to increase learners' identification as members of the STEM community. The course will also serve to provide learners with an enduring understanding of scientific topics and the ability to think critically about observed phenomena.<br/><br/>A significant obstacle in understanding the chemical evolution of the intergalactic medium is turning observations of quasar absorption lines into reliable estimates of metal content. In an effort to address this obstacle, the primary objectives of this work will be to characterize the mass content and ionization properties of the intergalactic and circumgalactic media and use the results to interpret current observations and inform future ones. The PI will meet these objectives by carrying out a suite of state-of-the art cosmological simulations that employ a newly-developed chemical network solver, enabling non-equilibrium calculations of the ionization structure of the intergalactic and circumgalactic media. Using completed simulations, the PI will leverage a novel technique for generating synthetic quasar absorption line spectra and compare the results to observations from the Hubble Space Telescope's Cosmic Origins Spectrograph. The PI will then compile a catalog that links spectral features to the physical conditions that generated them. Alongside this research program, the PI plans to design and teach a new course for first year undergraduate students that focuses on topics in astronomy and is built using the elements of inquiry-based learning. Distinct from traditional teaching practices, an inquiry-based approach to teaching and learning can be very effective at creating an enduring understanding of scientific topics and increasing the likelihood that students of all backgrounds identify as members of the STEM community."

Unlike in classical celestial mechanics, the motion in such ultra-relativistic binaries is complicated by the loss of energy and angular momentum to gravitational waves (GWs), which causes the orbiting bodies to spiral inward and eventually merge. Unfortunately, systematic numerical study of inspiraling black hole binaries is not possible in the status quo with either numerical relativity (too computationally expensive) or Post-Newtonian approximations (too inaccurate).<br/><br/>However, when the ratio of the masses is extremely small, as when a stellar-mass BH orbits a supermassive galactic BH, the inspiral calculation becomes tractable. The background Kerr spacetime of the larger BH can be regarded as static, the motion of the smaller BH is well approximated as test particle motion in that spacetime, and GW emission and fluxes of conserved quantities can be calculated perturbatively and their back-reaction on the orbit determined. The resulting extreme mass ratio inspiral (EMRI) can be calculated as an adiabatic transit through a sequence of Kerr geodesics. Dr. Scott Hughes at MIT and his collaborators have developed a gold-standard frequency domain code that computes extremely accurate orbits and waveforms for EMRIs of arbitrary initial inclination and eccentricity. Alas, the code still requires ~1.5 CPU-years to generate a single inspiral, making it unsuitable in its present form to study EMRI dynamics systematically.<br/><br/>Dr. Perez-Giz will adapt this code to achieve a many-fold improvement in computational efficiency via a technique exploiting special properties of periodic geodesics around Kerr black holes. An analog to CMBFAST for EMRIs, the resulting GWFaster will make batch calculation of EMRIs on MIT?s Beowulf cluster computationally feasible. Such a tool to compute EMRIs in bulk over large ranges of parameters will allow systematic numerical exploration of myriad unanswered questions in the dynamics of EMRIs, including how initial conditions determine the routes to merger, whether there can be transient resonances between the different orbital frequencies of the infalling object during the inspiral, and how adding spin to the test particle would affect the dynamics. The results will fill a crucial gap in our knowledge of dissipative gravitational dynamics in the only regime in which comparisons to analytic GR solutions are possible.<br/><br/>Dr. Perez-Giz will also conduct a pilot program to help minority and low-income students to access higher education in the physical sciences. Through partnerships with the AT Foundation, a charitable organization that seeks to address the nation's enduring crisis of inequality in education, and Prep for Prep and the Leadership Enterprise for a Diverse America (LEDA), two organizations that advance the educations of minority and low-income students, the proposed educational program will introduce into Prep for Prep and LEDA both advanced research exposure and tiered mentoring for high school and undergraduate students. Both groups already place their low-income and minority participants in top-tier boarding schools and undergraduate institutions in the Boston area but have no formal science-specific research skills training, mentoring or advising in their programs. Giving their student bases the opportunity to develop basic ""knife skills"" for the physical sciences while they are still in high school and offering guidance during and beyond their undergraduate careers will be a powerful vehicle for addressing the underrepresentation of these same students in the physical sciences."

Dr. Sullivan will conduct experiments employing two types of measurements to study the epoch of reionization when the first stars and galaxies formed--the Cosmic Infrared Background Experiment (CIBER), which will measure the fluctuations in the cosmic near-infrared background (NIRB) from the first galaxies, and the Murchison Widefield Array (MWA), which will map the structure of neutral hydrogen (HI) as it is ionized by those galaxies. The best measurements to date of the epoch of reionization exist from measurements of the cosmic microwave background, which indicate that the optical depth due to Thomson scattering is 0.089 +/- 0.030. Additional measures are needed, however, to reveal a more complete picture of reionization and, consequently, the history of the universe. Using two such measures, which incorporate very different technologies and are susceptible to different systematics, will, taken together, gather complementary information and serve as important cross-checks on each measurement. <br/><br/>For CIBER Dr. Sullivan has led the fabrication of the instruments and analysis of the imager data; under this award he will continue that analysis, leading to the first definitive measurement of NIRB fluctuations from a targeted mission. CIBER consists of four infrared instruments on board a NASA sounding rocket, which has already achieved one successful flight. Over the course of the next few years, CIBER will launch an additional three times, culminating in a long-duration non-recoverable flight and followed by a complete redesign of the instrument with two more launches. The four instruments of CIBER include two spectrometers to measure the absolute brightness of the Infrared background from 700-1800 nm, and two wide-field imagers to measure NIRB fluctuations at 1000 nm and 1600 nm. <br/><br/>Dr. Sullivan will work concurrently on the MWA with Dr. Miguel Morales at UW. The MWA is a radio interferometer that operates in the frequency range of 80-300 MHz, which is tuned to the 21-cm line of HI from the redshift ranges appropriate to the epoch of reionization. Since the MWA measures a redshifted line of radiation over a wide range of frequencies, it is possible to map the HI distribution over the course of reionization. The instrument is currently under construction in the radio-quiet zone of Western Australia, and Dr. Sullivan will assist with the instrument deployment and commissioning. Dr. Sullivan will thus gain sufficient familiarity with the instrument to undertake the precision data analysis necessary to remove foregrounds and instrumental effects. Finally, through an active role in both CIBER and MWA collaborations, Dr. Sullivan will cross-correlate data from the instruments where they observe the same field to look for the anti-correlations implied by their origins.<br/><br/>Dr. Sullivan will also initiate a series of hands-on workshops for high school students, designed to expose them to scientific research. Using the CIBER project as a model, students in the program will learn about astrophysics, design a small science experiment, rigorously test and calibrate it, and launch it on a model rocket. The students will assemble a poster based on the results of their project for public display and will write independent reports of the experience. These reports may be used for college application essays, which will encourage them to pursue a degree in science."

Graur will study two types of transients: Type Ia Supernovae (SNe Ia), which are supernovae occurring in two stars orbiting one another; and Tidal Disruption Events (TDE), which are bright flares produced when a supermassive black hole (SMBH) at the center of a galaxy disrupts the material from a nearby star.

Graur will also build a mentoring program in which postdoctoral scholars and graduate students will supervise high school students in advanced scientific research projects. <br/><br/>Graur will enhance his supernova detection code to enable detection of all types of transients in large scale spectroscopic galaxy surveys, starting with the Sloan Digital Sky Survey, and will integrate the enhanced code into the upcoming Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument survey. The focus of his research will be to enlarge the number of SNe Ia and TDE detections to make statistical analyses of these events possible. Assembling a statistical sample of SNe Ia would allow measurement of SNe Ia rates as a function of galaxy stellar mass, thereby improving constraints on the nature of SNe Ia progenitors. Similarly, enlarging the number of TDE detections through dedicated surveys would allow a better understanding of the behavior of TDEs, and stellar parameters inferred from the TDE emission would provide a novel method to measure SMBH masses and mass distributions. For the educational component of his work, Graur will develop a research mentoring program called SRMP@Harvard, in which about 15 postdoctoral scholars and advanced graduate students will supervise about 50 high school students from the Cambridge and Boston areas in active scientific research."

The fellow's project involves exoplanets.  Today, astronomers are discovering a rich panoply of exoplanets in our Galaxy.  Many of these exoplanets are in multi-planet systems.  Some show surprisingly different characteristics from our own Solar System that pose serious problems for standard isolated planet formation theories.  Strong evidence indicates that the majority of stars form in clusters, many of which dissolve within the age of the Universe.  Therefore, many of the exoplanets observed today---in stars clusters and the field of the Galaxy---may have been born inside star clusters and subjected to past perturbations from nearby stars.  Understanding how stellar encounters within this birth environment affect the dynamical evolution of planetary systems is paramount to interpreting the characteristics of all the newly discovered exoplanets and how these relate to the planet formation epoch. <br/><br/>To address these important questions, the fellow work with a team of experts to complete development of the first computer code to self-consistently simulate the dynamical evolution of multi-planet systems in realistic star clusters.  Dr. Geller and collaborators have already completed a pilot code demonstrating the feasibility of the most critical and innovative components, and the full code will be completed early in the first year of the fellowship.  The fellow will then use this code to model nine open star clusters, including four in the Kepler field that have been surveyed comprehensively for transiting exoplanets.  Each cluster will be modeled with multiple different initial planet populations to cover the range in characteristics of observed exoplanets.  The simulations will be analyzed, accounting for the unique sensitivity limits of each transit survey, and the results will be compared directly with the observations.  This project will reveal---for the first time self-consistently---how stellar encounters within star clusters of a wide range in age, density, mass, etc., influence the dynamical evolution of multi-planet systems including those like our Solar System and how the characteristics of exoplanets observed today in both clusters and the field may have been modified in the past by their birth environment.<br/><br/>The broader impacts of this project include a significant educational component.  The fellow will undertake a program of educational outreach in partnership with the Northwestern's NSF-funded GK-12 and CE21 programs to develop, test, and disseminate about 15 high school lesson plans based on the scientific research of this project.  The fellow will work directly with a Northwestern graduate student to develop around five classroom-tested high school lesson plans each year.  To supplement the lesson plans, the fellow will also develop a web-based student-friendly interface to both analyze the products of the proposed simulations and to allow students to run simulations of their own.  During years 2 and 3 the fellow will integrate these lesson plans into teacher professional development workshops, which the PI will co-lead.  Through these workshops, the fellow will train  about 20 Chicago Public School and area teachers to use his lesson plans, thereby reaching about 2000 students with his curricular materials by the end of the fellowship.  Both the GK-12 and CE21 programs are well established at Northwestern University and have been running successfully for years.

Many projects are centered on unraveling these mysteries.  In this project the fellow will study the detailed chemical evolution of galaxies beyond the Local Group by obtaining chemical abundances of over 20 individual chemical elements from integrated light spectra of star clusters.  The fellow's technique enables chemical abundance measurements in galaxies as distant as 13 million light-years that were previously only possible in galaxies within a half million light-years distance, i.e., our own Milky Way Galaxy and its nearby satellite galaxies.

Type Ia supernovae (SNe Ia) are thermonuclear explosions of white dwarf stars, and because such features as their peak brightness and the rate at which they fade away are reliably predicable, they are used to measure distances to other galaxies.  As a result, these supernovae help astrophysicists to measure cosmological parameters and to determine the expansion history of the Universe.  Their use ultimately led to the discovery of the accelerating Universe, for which the Nobel Prize in Physics was awarded in 2011.  The fellow will apply new distance measurement methods that utilize spectral observations in addition to photometric data in order to refine their use.<br/><br/>Despite their cosmological utility, astrophysicists still do not fully understand the process by which the exploding white dwarf reaches the Chandrasekhar limit, whether it actually reaches the limit (or significantly exceeds it in some cases), what progenitor scenarios and environments lead to SNe Ia, or the details of how the explosion itself occurs.  To help resolve these and other issues, Dr. Silverman will explore the population of SN Ia host galaxies as well as undertake detailed studies of both ""normal"" and ""peculiar"" nearby, bright SNe Ia.  Data for these in-depth investigations will be obtained at the very earliest times (i.e., hours after explosion) to 1--2 years past maximum brightness.

Isler is working to understand the fundamental physical processes that produce the highly variable and multiwavelength emission detected in blazars. The outcome of this study will help astrophysicists better understand the interplay between the infalling accretion material and outflowing jet material. In this way, one can in principle build up a full geometric picture of the flow of matter and resulting radiation in these galactic black hole systems. Isler is equally committed to creating spaces for students of color to thrive in academic settings in general and STEM disciplines in particular. Her personal experience informs her passion, as she has been in safe spaces as well as survived overtly and covertly hostile environments in her pursuit of scientific excellence. It is her goal to continue that pursuit while building academic spaces that are welcoming to an ever wider portion of the population. <br/><br/>The blazar study relies on simultaneous, multiwavelength data obtained from NASA Fermi Gamma-Ray Space Telescope and the Small and Medium Aperture Research Telescope System, which provides optical and infrared data. Together, these two datasets are used to constrain the physical mechanisms responsible for the highest energy gamma-ray emission we observe. Furthermore, when optical spectroscopic data are also obtained, the location of the gamma-emitting region can be better localized. This localization of the high energy emission allows us to distinguish between competing models for the physical mechanisms that drive these processes. The national alumni network will begin with the Fisk Vanderbilt Masters-to-PhD Bridge Program and augment the already active Research Showcase on campus. This gathering of current students will form the basis of an annual alumni gathering. Furthermore, state-of-the-art online tools will be used to build and maintain the virtual community that is critical to cementing relationships developed during the annual campus visit. Finally, since the ultimate goal of this portion of the project is to replicate this network on a national scale, a key deliverable will be a best practices toolkit to be shared with other Bridge programs across the country."

The development of large telescopes, sensitive instruments and deep surveys has allowed astronomers to detect highly star-forming galaxies back to a few hundred million years after the Big Bang (z~8). These exciting discoveries are implicitly focused on the most extreme types of star-bursting galaxies, whose light can be detected over such great distances. To develop a complete understanding of galaxy formation, these studies must be augmented by a solid understanding of typical galaxies, i.e. those galaxies that contain the majority of the baryonic matter in the universe. However, studying these typical galaxies is difficult because they are generally too faint to be directly detected in emission. Instead, these galaxies, known as the Damped Lyman alpha Systems (DLAs), have been probed in absorption against more distant background quasars.<br/><br/>While the DLAs are known to contain the majority of the neutral gas in the universe between z = 0-5, their precise role in galaxy formation is obscured by the nature of their detection--with only a pencil beam line of sight through each galaxy--and as a result not much is known about DLA sizes, masses, morphologies, and kinematics, leaving open several important questions: (1) As the high redshift hosts of the majority of the fuel for star formation, what is their connection with star formation and the star forming galaxies? (2) What is their role in galaxy formation and evolution scenarios? and (3) While the absorption line kinematics are consistent with massive spiral galaxies at z~2, this model poses a challenge to hierarchical theories of galaxy formation, which predict most objects at z>2 to have circular velocities much less than those of typical massive spirals.<br/><br/>To understand DLAs and their connection to the star forming galaxies, this proposal aims to (1) take advantage of OSIRIS, the sensitive, new Integral Field Unit (IFU) with laser guide star adaptive optics (LGSAO) on the Keck telescope, to effectively subtract the background quasar light and directly image the H-alpha (and [N II], [O III]) emission of a sample of DLAs known to have relatively high star formation rates; and (2) utilize the ultra-high resolution spectrograph of the Subaru telescope to resolve and probe the physics of the very cold and dense velocity components that are proposed to be progenitor sites of star formation within DLA galaxies.<br/><br/>Observations and simulations suggest that ~50% of DLAs, those with high metallicities and star formation rates as measured by their absorption profiles, are associated with bright, compact knots of star formation, whose emission can be detected with the help of LGSAO OSIRIS IFU observations. OSIRIS will be able to trace the velocity profiles and look for evidence of rotation, inflow, or outflow. Comparing [N II]/H-alpha ratio, a reliable indicator of the oxygen abundance in the ionized gas, as well as other diagnostics of star formation with those of the absorption line data will lead to a greater understanding of metallicity gradients, kinematics and star formation in the entire population of absorption line systems and provide vital constraints on simulations of galaxy formation. Analysis of ultra-high resolution spectra will complement this study with detailed understanding of the metallicity and molecule distribution in cold, dense clouds that may be gravitationally confined and represent precursor sites of star formation in DLAs.<br/><br/>Dr. Jorgenson will also design an inquiry-based astronomy course for middle/high school students and teach the course via IfA's well-established HI STAR program. This program recruits native Hawaiians, underrepresented minorities, and students from low socioeconomic backgrounds to participate in week-long astronomy courses. The proposed course will emphasize the importance of Mauna Kea to astronomical research, vital outreach needed to maintain harmonious access to and possible further growth on the sacred mountain of Mauna Kea. In addition, at least three undergraduate students will be mentored as part of the NSF Research Experiences for Undergraduates program with particular attention paid to encouraging the participation of women and under-represented minorities in astronomy."

A major achievement for the field of extragalactic astronomy over the past decade has been the detection of supermassive black holes in the centers of nearby galaxies, and the discovery of correlations between the black hole mass and properties of the host galaxy bulge. About 50 black hole mass measurements have been made to date, most often through the dynamical modeling of stars or nuclear gas disks. While the black hole mass - host galaxy bulge correlations have been clearly established, the determination of the true shape and scatter of the relationships is an evolving process that will continue to change with advances in both observational and modeling techniques.<br/><br/>Dr. Walsh proposes to investigate and quantify the biases in both stellar and gas dynamical methods through the re-evaluation of existing measurements, and to make new mass measurements with the aim of addressing uncertainties associated with certain supermassive black hole demographics. She will focus on three projects: (1) determining the biases in previous stellar dynamical black hole mass measurements that neglected to model the dark matter halo's contribution to the gravitational potential, (2) revising gas dynamical black hole mass measurements previously made using the Hubble Space Telescope (HST) Faint Object Spectrograph by acquiring much higher quality data and applying a more comprehensive analysis, and (3) increasing the number of black hole mass measurements at the high-end of the black hole mass - host galaxy bulge relationships. In order to carry out her research, Dr. Walsh will obtain high-resolution observations with integral field spectrographs assisted by adaptive optics and with the HST Space Telescope Imaging Spectrograph. She will also acquire large-scale observations using the unique instrument VIRUS-P on the 2.7m telescope at the McDonald Observatory.<br/><br/>Dr. Walsh will also develop an interactive video conference program on black holes specifically aimed at high-school students. The new educational content will be integrated into the existing ""Live from McDonald Observatory!"" program run by the McDonald Observatory. These live video conferences allow students to take a virtual field trip to the observatory, and include tours of the observatory, hands-on activities that encourage the exploration of a science topic, and science demonstrations. Dr. Walsh will develop pre- and post-conference activities that will focus on the fundamental properties of black holes and the nature of active galactic nuclei. She will participate in the production of the video conference either remotely from UT Austin or through a pre-recorded portion. The materials and activities that she develops for the program will also be available for other UT Austin scientists to bring to high-school classrooms. Last year, the observatory connected with over 150 schools and reached thousands of students. Hispanics and African Americans account for a majority of the enrollment in Texas public schools, and over half of the students in the public school system are classified as economically disadvantaged. Therefore, the video conferences will reach a large number of students from underrepresented groups."

A key mission in astronomy is to understand the ages and histories of stars within our galaxy, yet their ages remain one of the most difficult properties to measure. When stars are young they spin rapidly and exhibit strong magnetic activity, including frequent high energy flares that can potentially impact life on nearby planets. Stars lose angular momentum over time, slowing their rotation, which should decrease this magnetic activity and generate fewer flares. This change in flare rate can be used as an approximate clock and is crucial for understanding how stars and planets evolve over time. To calibrate this clock, Davenport will use the ultra-precise data from NASA's planet-hunting Kepler mission as a training sample, finding every flare from over 200,000 stars. This work requires analyzing large volumes of data using modern computational techniques. Davenport will use this Kepler data to train students at smaller institutions core principles of data science and visualization, which are critical for work in technical fields.<br/><br/>Using stellar magnetic activity as a clock has long been suggested as a possible means for determining stellar ages. Furthermore, planet habitability may be impacted by the evolution of the host star's magnetic activity over time. Interest in low-mass stars as exoplanet hosts has fueled a growing need for better constraints on stellar ages. With the advent of continuous monitoring from space-based missions like Kepler, we are finally able to calibrate this method. Davenport will develop the first measurement of this activity-age relationship by studying the flare rates of stars from the Kepler mission. Over 200,000 stars will be studied for flares using machine learning and time series statistical techniques. This endeavor will involve using modern data science techniques to mine large databases. The demand for such skills in the private and public sectors is growing rapidly, and Davenport will use large, dynamic, and open access astronomical datasets to teach data science methods. Gaining experience in data science for STEM majors can be challenging at smaller institutions, and data from the Kepler mission are ideal for teaching these skills. The course will also serve as a template for data science STEM training in other departments at small institutions."

A wealth of observations have shown that galaxy mergers are common and that nearly all galaxies host a central supermassive black hole (SMBH); consequently, some galaxies must host two SMBHs as the result of recent mergers. The two SMBHs are known as ""dual SMBHs"" for the first ~100 Myr after the merger when they are at separations >1 kpc. These dual SMBHs have significant potential as probes of galaxy evolution, as they are observational tracers of galaxy mergers, the role of active galactic nuclei (AGN) in galaxy mergers, and SMBH mergers. However, the full potential of dual SMBHs for studies of these topics has not yet been realized, due to the small number of known dual-SMBH systems. Dr. Comerford proposes to use optical spectroscopy to increase the number of known dual SMBHs several folds and build a statistical catalog of 0 < z < 2 dual SMBHs.

Dr. Morsony will also determine how a range of different cluster environments affect the AGN, with the goal of creating a general prescription for AGN feedback that can be used in cosmological simulations where AGN jets are unresolved.<br/><br/>A feedback mechanism is necessary to prevent the runaway cooling and in-fall of gas in galaxy clusters. The primary candidate for feedback is AGN powered by accretion of cool gas, which create jet outflows that heat the cluster gas to form a self-regulating cycle of cooling, accretion, outflow and heating. Understanding how feedback operates is critical to our interpretation of observations of galaxy clusters and to understanding large-scale structure formation. The proposed research will carry out a series of three-dimensional numerical simulations of AGN outflows in galaxy clusters. The simulations will include magnetohydrodynamics, gas cooling and star formation, and a link between accretion rate and AGN luminosity.

Study of such regions will advance our understanding of star formation not only in our own Galaxy, but in other galaxies and to higher redshift where such extreme environments are much more common. High spatial resolution near-infrared observations will be used to penetrate the dust and gas that obscures these distant and embedded clusters and resolve individual stars in the dense cluster cores.

Furthermore, extending the time-baseline for existing astrometric observations of one cluster in the W51 molecular cloud will allow me to measure the internal kinematics of the cluster. This will provide an estimate of the total cluster mass, constrain the dissipation timescale of the cluster, enable a search for kinematic sub-structure as evidence for dissolving sub-clusters, and reveal the importance of competitive accretion between stars as they move through their parent molecular cloud.<br/><br/>Dr. Lu will also address education, outreach, and diversity on two fronts.

Understanding the boundary between very low mass stars and brown dwarfs has deep implications for the search for life in the Universe. It is likely that life may evolve on planets orbiting stars but it is more difficult for life to evolve on brown dwarf systems due to their constantly changing temperature. Dr. Dieterich studies trends in temperature, radius, and luminosity of objects near the stellar/substellar boundary. His thesis work identified a stellar and a substellar population based on these trends. This work will now be extended to a larger sample of stars, and will explore how chemical compositions for different stars change this boundary. Dr. Dieterich will use his experience as a former middle and high school physical science teacher to facilitate the integration of astronomy in the high school physics curriculum. He will compile an activity book that will serve as a resource for physics teachers who wish to enrich their classes by illustrating physical concepts with examples from astronomy. <br/><br/>Dr. Dieterich will address the following three scientific questions during his fellowship: (1) What is the luminosity function at the stellar/substellar boundary? (2) How does metallicity affect the properties of objects with masses close to the hydrogen burning minimum mass? and (3) How can we use objects with known dynamical masses to create a more robust and detailed Mass-Luminosity Relation at the stellar/substellar boundary? The unique resources of Carnegie's Las Campanas Observatory in Chile are key to answering these questions. Because an accurate distance measurement is essential for establishing luminosity and radius, Dr. Dieterich and collaborators will use the Carnegie Astrometric Planet Search Camera (CAPSCam) on the du Pont 2.5 meter telescope to determine precise trigonometric parallaxes so as to make the study sample volume-complete. Several Las Campanas telescopes will also be used to obtain optical photometry for these very faint objects, which is necessary for calculating bolometric fluxes. Metallicities for the sample will be established through spectroscopic observations done with the Magellan 6.5 meter telescopes. The MagAO adaptive optics system on the Magellan II telescope is one of the only ground based systems capable of obtaining diffraction-limited images in optical wavelengths. This unique capability will be used for the photometric characterization of stars in close binary systems for which dynamical masses are known. The resolved optical photometry will then be used to determine luminosity and effective temperature for these stars, therefore populating the mass-luminosity relation."

A longstanding problem in astrophysics is to understand how galaxies form and develop---or evolve---throughout their lifetimes.  Such understanding is necessary to uncover how our Universe evolved and to gain insight into the origin of our own Milky Way Galaxy.  One important aspect of understanding galaxy evolution is to study how large region of newly forming stars in certain galaxies interact with the massive black holes at the centers (nuclei) of these galaxies, which is the central theme of this fellow's project.<br/><br/>By using the largest sample of quasar absorption lines (QALs), the fellow will address outstanding questions regarding the enrichment history of the intergalactic medium and its connection to feedback from star formation and Active Galactic Nuclei (AGN) in galaxies.  QALs provide uniquely unbiased probes of galactic environments over vast ranges in redshift, but only recently has the number density of spectroscopically observed high-redshift quasars, combined with the scale of deep galaxy surveys, provided sufficient statistics to study the associations between galaxies and absorption features in proximate quasar sightlines over wide ranges in redshift and galaxy properties.<br/><br/>Through her participation in the Sloan Digital Sky Survey III's Baryon Oscillation Spectroscopic Survey (BOSS), which will obtain spectra for 160,000 redshift z > 2.2 quasars over the next three years, the fellow will extract a 3-dimensional census of metal absorption lines in the redshift range z = 0.35 to 4.  Using this data set, already one order of magnitude larger than existing samples, she will precisely measure the evolution of the number density and equivalent width distribution for the most prolific metals in the intergalactic medium from redshift z around 4 to present.  Leveraging these data with her existing participation in numerous deep galaxy surveys, she will reveal the typical galactic environments of QALs from high redshift and constrain the physical distances to which galaxy and AGN outflows extend as a function of galaxy properties and redshift.  Together, these investigations will potentially revolutionize our understanding of feedback from star formation and AGN and its role in the co-evolution of galaxies and the intergalactic medium throughout about 90% of cosmic history.<br/><br/>The broader impacts of this project include a significant educational component.  The fellow will undertake a program of educational outreach in partnership with the UW Space Place, a well-established astronomy outreach center in Madison.  Within this facility she will conduct a series of weekend workshops for students in grades 6 through 8 using a well-tested curriculum of inquiry-based modern astronomy activities that she designed for a previous educational program.  The fellow will supplement these student-focussed sessions with a shorter series of evening workshops for local high school science teachers that are designed to familiarize educators with activities using the public interface to the Sloan Digital Sky Survey, the Skyserver.  These programs will serve the next generation of scientists by providing students at a critical age with a positive introduction to modern astronomy research in addition to providing their future educators with the tools to foster further explorations in the high school classroom."

Galaxies in dense groups and clusters, unlike ordinary field galaxies like the Milky Way, are subject to extreme astrophysical processes that remove their gas and shut down star formation. These processes are far from gentle; many galaxies go through a violent evolutionary phase before settling into their eventual passive gas-poor states. During this phase, star formation and supermassive black hole activity within galaxies can be triggered by strong pressure in the ambient gas. Energy injected by these stars and supermassive black holes can in turn replenish gas lost from galaxies, further continuing this cycle. These processes, mysteriously, operate in the presence of other mechanisms in dense environments that should destroy galactic gas. While there is abundant observational evidence that these processes operate in cluster galaxies, a theoretical understanding of the physics driving the energy cycle in group and cluster galaxies remains elusive. Vijayaraghavan will exploit recent advances in computing and astrophysical software development to carry out a simulations-based investigation into these extreme astrophysical phenomena. She will also run an educational program to promote enthusiasm for computational astrophysics in middle-school-aged girl students. These students will be exposed to the latest scientific developments and techniques in modern astrophysics through computer- and telescope-based activities.<br/><br/>Solving the problem of galaxy evolution in cluster environments requires modeling and disentangling the contribution of multiple simultaneous complex physical phenomena, operating over six orders of magnitude in physical scale. Vijayaraghavan will perform a series of supercomputer simulations using the FLASH code to progressively incorporate multiple physics modules, and use adaptive mesh refinement to focus computational resources on interesting regions. In these simulations, cosmologically realistic red and blue galaxies, including their stellar and gas components, will be allowed to evolve within massive group and cluster environments in the presence of progressively complex physical processes. Based on these simulations, Vijayaraghavan will identify and disentangle the physical mechanisms triggering star formation and black hole activity in cluster galaxies, and investigate the impacts of these processes on cluster galaxy evolution. She will also generate mock observations from simulations to directly compare with radio, optical, and X-ray observations of the hot and cold gas, star formation, and black hole activity in cluster galaxies. This project will use supercomputing resources at the University of Virginia and NSF XSEDE supercomputers. The educational component of this program will be based around summer day camps, where girls will gain an understanding of modern astrophysics through a combination of interactive presentations and hands-on experience with computers and observatory telescopes.  The object of these camps will be to inspire girls to pursue careers in STEM fields."

One of the most pressing problems in galaxy formation concerns how gas accretion and feedback influence the evolution of galaxies.  Galaxy evolution is regulated by the ability of galaxies to accrete and retain gas to continue star formation, but how does matter cycle in and out of galaxies?  Recent theoretical studies suggest that predominantly ionized material may infall onto galaxies through intergalactic filaments, but it is unclear whether the gas will evaporate in the halo before reaching the galactic disk.  In contrast, feedback from massive stars expels gas and quenches star formation by heating and ionizing the gas.  To understand outflow and inflow processes in galaxies at greater distances, the fellow in this project will study them in the local Universe, where they can be studied in detail.<br/><br/>To decipher the flows in the circumgalactic gas of the Milky Way, the fellow will combine Wisconsin H-Alpha Mapper (WHAM) optical and Hubble Space Telescope ultraviolet spectroscopic observations of the Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC) outflow and Magellanic Stream to test if dwarf galaxies can sustain massive galaxy star formation and to test the origin of the gaseous structures feeding galaxies.  The Magellanic Clouds are nearby enough to exploit the power of absorption- and emission-line spectroscopy, allowing investigators to measure the density, temperature, metallicity, kinematics, and morphologies of the diffuse circumgalactic gas.  Through these observations the fellow will investigate the LMC stellar outflows and the Magellanic Stream to determine their basic physical properties, the source of their ionization, their extent and morphology, and their fate.  Establishing a new perpective of the gaseous flows in our own Galactic environment will provide a firmer basis to understand the implications of gas detected far from galaxies throughout the Universe.<br/><br/>The broader impacts of this project include a significant educational component.  The fellow will create a Professional Resource Development program for the Physics Department at the University of Notre Dame.  This program will consist of an annual professional development seminar along with complementary workshops.  The Professional Resource Development seminar will include topics on traditional academic and alternative career paths, networking, and job applications in conjunction with members of the Professional Development Committee at Notre Dame, whose membership includes the Kaneb Center for Teaching and Learning, Writing Center, Graduate School, English for Academic Purposes, Reilly Center for Science, among others.  Each summer this program will include three workshops on Curriculum Vitae, research statements, and cover letters and will stress the importance of strong communication skills and tailoring documents to different audiences.

One of the most important open questions in the field of astrophysics is how galaxies acquire their gas and transform it into stars, a process that uniquely determines the evolutionary path of each galaxy over cosmic time. Observations of the circumgalactic medium, the gas reservoir surrounding a galaxy, are the key to understanding how galaxies accrete and process gas; however these observations are difficult to interpret because they require infrequent bright background objects to illuminate the foreground circumgalactic medium. Hummels will construct a ""synthetic telescope,"" a piece of software for mimicking the observations made by real telescopes of this gas reservoir, and apply it to advanced supercomputer simulations of large volumes of the Universe containing thousands of galaxies. These simulated galaxies will provide context for better understanding observations made by real telescopes. In addition, Hummels will organize a public education program as a collaborative effort between Caltech and Pasadena City College. This outreach program will have frequent traditional and non-traditional events focused on increasing scientific interest and awareness in the general population of the greater Los Angeles area.<br/><br/>Hummels will integrate several existing open-source codes into a ""synthetic telescope"" software pipeline for post-processing hydrodynamical simulations of galaxy evolution to generate simulated observations. This pipeline will account for (1) dust; (2) self-shielding effects of dense gas pockets; (3) atomic line transfer; (4) local photoionizing sources including stars and active galactic nuclei; (5) metagalactic ionizing background radiation; (6) collisional ionization; and (7) equilibrium and non-equilibrium ionization. It will be compatible with standard hydrodynamical codes and will produce photometric images, IFU data, and spectra spanning the wavelength range from the ultraviolet to the submillimeter. Hummels will apply this pipeline to the FIRE, CGM@HR, and AGORA simulations. He will compare these synthetic observations to the COS-Halos and KBSS surveys of the circumgalactic medium to investigate the origin and structure of the circumgalactic medium as it varies with galaxy mass, environment, and redshift, to better understand galactic gas accretion and ejection. Hummels will then release the software pipeline to the astrophysical community. Concurrent to this research effort, Hummels will organize a public education program to host frequent activities for scientific enrichment of the general public.

Wolfgang aims to better understand the characteristics and possible histories of these planets by adopting a big-picture approach which incorporates the available yet incomplete information about each.  In particular, she will combine physical models of different evolutionary processes with a sophisticated population-wide statistical framework to identify the most probable ways that these planets came to have their current compositions and orbits.  For her education efforts, Wolfgang will develop and implement interactive, hands-on activities for a multicultural community of Penn State freshmen who are interested in pursuing careers in science and engineering.  Because these activities more genuinely reflect the process of scientific inquiry and discovery than most college laboratory assignments and coursework, these students will gain valuable experience with the skills needed to do cutting-edge research and will begin to develop confidence and an identity as a scientist.<br/><br/>The Kepler Mission has demonstrated that sub-Neptune-sized planets are ubiquitous in our Galaxy, yet it is a challenge to understand their compositional structure and to explain their close-in orbits.  Progress on these and other topics in planet formation and evolution theory has been challenged by large measurement uncertainties as well as significant detection biases and selection effects in the detected Kepler population.  Wolfgang will meet this need for a more data-driven approach by coupling a sophisticated hierarchical Bayesian framework to physical models and theoretical simulations of important evolutionary processes.  In particular, she will investigate the compositional and orbital evolution of super-Earths and sub-Neptunes, quantifying the degree to which photoevaporation and Kozai-Lidov oscillations have affected these planets' properties since the dispersal of their protoplanetary disks.  In doing so, Wolfgang will be able to supply robust end conditions to planet formation theory and accelerate theoretical understanding of the dominant processes during planet formation.  Wolfgang will mentor female astrophysics undergraduate and graduate students, advise undergraduate research projects, serve as an instructor for the Penn State Summer School in Statistics for Astronomers, and implement inquiry-based activities to encourage the students in these programs - who often are members of minority groups underrepresented in the sciences - to develop scientific thinking skills and an identity as a scientist."

Upcoming space missions will enable astronomers to observationally test theoretical models for supermassive black hole (SMBH) growth for the first time. How SMBHs formed so quickly, during the first billion years of the Universe, remains a central puzzle of cosmology and galaxy evolution. One candidate formation pathway is through supermassive stars (SMSs) that could have formed in the direct collapse of primordial gas clouds. At the end of their lifetimes, the collapse of SMSs may result in black holes with seed masses large enough to be the progenitors of SMBHs; powerful thermonuclear explosions with no remnants; or black hole-explosion combinations. Yet our understanding of SMS collapse, its set of outcomes, and their signatures is in its infancy. Moran's research program will comprehensively address SMS evolution, producing predictions that can be tested by upcoming missions to help untangle the formation channel of SMBHs. Moran's program also includes a significant educational component, which will give a computing school, the Summer Space Programming Challenge to Pasadena area high school students and teachers.<br/><br/>Much theoretical work is still needed to understand SMS collapse/explosion dynamics and to predict their observational multimessenger (electromagnetic, gravitational wave, neutrino, nucleosynthetic) signatures in preparation and support of upcoming space missions such as the NASA James Webb Space Telescope, the NASA Wide-Field Infrared Survey Telescope, and the ESA Euclid mission. SMS collapse is a promising pathway to SMBH formation, yet its simulation with the necessary microphysics (stellar equation of state, nuclear reactions) and approximate or full general relativity has thus far been limited to spherical or axial symmetry, completely ignoring magnetic fields and 3D dynamics. Lightcurve and spectral modeling has only been performed for a single SMS explosion model. Moran's research program will comprehensively address SMS evolution through collapse and potential explosion in 3D general relativistic magnetohydrodynamic simulations with detailed microphysics, producing observables across the SMS parameter space spanned by mass, metallicity, rotation, and magnetization. Necessary code development in support of the program will be released as open source.

Massive stars are largely responsible for regulating the intensity of star formation over cosmic stretches of time. Nearly any attempt to interpret observations of galaxies requires understanding the massive stars. Despite their importance, current models of massive stars do not match current observations. Historically, calibrations of massive stars models are limited to a relatively small number of stars formed in similar environments, and models of massive stars in other environments are largely extrapolations. With the recent surge in large surveys that reveal individual stars in more distant galaxies, astronomers now have the necessary data to significantly improve massive star models in a diverse set of environments. The educational program aims to increase the confidence and enthusiasm in learning astronomy of Boston Middle School students by preparing students to create and present their own digital planetarium shows. <br/><br/>The primary goal of this program is to systematically calibrate the uncertain aspects of widely used, state-of-the-art stellar evolution models, using the best possible data as constraints across the widest range of metallicity.

To assess which is the most probable stellar evolution model given the observational constraints, Rosenfield will calculate large sets of stellar models spanning the uncertain model parameter space as well as the metallicity range of the data. Each set will then be statistically compared to observational data. By requiring acceptable fits across all metallicities and masses, not only will the best fitting parameters become known, but any degeneracies between parameters will be revealed. For the educational program, Rosenfield will work with volunteers and teachers to prepare Boston Middle School students to give digital planetarium shows to their peers."

Due to the lower pressures and densities in the tidal debris, this study probes the lower bounds of where star formation is possible. To attract a diverse workforce in science and engineering, a new astronomy outreach initiative, Multicultural Milky Way, will engage under-served populations in Arizona in learning about our Milky Way and other galaxies. Arizona is home to many diverse populations with rich cultural histories such as Mayan, Navajo, and Apache.

It remains unknown whether the physical characteristics of galaxies were determined at the time of their formation or are the result of ongoing evolution through environmentally induced processes.  In this project the fellow will perform a statistical analysis of galaxy environments at the peak of cosmic star formation, when a large fraction of local galaxies were formed and assembled.  He will apply a unique method that he demonstrated at intermediate galaxy distances and will extract luminosity functions for a large sample of galaxy groups and clusters at a redshift of z = 2, revealing the typical environments of the high redshift Universe.  He will then employ these results to test whether the local correlations between galaxy properties and environment were already in place 10 billion years ago.  To do so, the fellow will utilize the data sets of the Cosmic Assembly Near-infrared Deep Extragalactic Legacy Survey (CANDELS) and the 3D-HST survey, complementary surveys of the early Universe with the new infrared camera on the Hubble Space Telescope.  This is the first time that such a study will be possible at redshift of z ~ 2, and it will unveil clues regarding the balance between internal and external processes at great distances.<br/><br/>The broader impacts of this project include a significant educational component.  First, the fellow will develop and teach a high-school level extragalactic astronomy class as part of COSMOS, the California State Summer School for Mathematics and Science.  Second, he will volunteer at the public observing nights hosted by the Santa Cruz Astronomy Club at the Harvey West Park Scout House.  Both of these activities promote scientific literacy through direct involvement and contact with the public."

The current cosmological paradigm includes two significant and unknown entities called ""dark matter"" and ""dark energy.""  The physics of the Universe is dominated by their presence even though their nature remains unknown.  Current investigations into the identity of dark matter focus on finding entirely new massive particles.  Many dark matter search experiments are currently planned or ongoing, and many of them are challenged by the large background signal from conventional astrophysical processes and a vast array of signatures that could indicate a dark matter interaction.  This project, part of the General Antiparticle Spectrometer (GAPS) experiment, aims to characterize the dark matter by detecting the low-energy subatomic particles predicted to be created as dark matter particles self-annihilate in the halo of our Milky Way Galaxy.  The postdoctoral fellow of this award will lead the commissioning of the detector system that would detect these particles in this project.<br/><br/>The strength of the GAPS experiment is that it promises to provide an essentially background-free signature of dark matter, and the anticipated measurements will probe large portions of the theoretical parameter spaces of both supersymmetry and extra-dimensional theories, the leading models of dark matter production, and will complement and extend the reach of current experiments.  Layers of semiconducting Si(Li) tracking detectors with excellent time and energy resolution are essential to the success of the GAPS detection and background rejection scheme.  GAPS will utilize over 1000 of these detectors, and thus a consistent procedure for qualification and calibration will be the bridge between the ideal experimental design and its final performance.  The fellow will spearhead the analysis of data from a prototype balloon flight and will lead the commissioning and calibration of these detectors.<br/><br/>The broader impacts of this project include a significant educational component.  The fellow will work with the Columbia University Double Discovery Center (DDC) to implement a laboratory course and mentoring program aimed at encouraging underrepresented students to pursue an education in a scientific field.  The fellow will establish a laboratory science course for junior high school students with lessons based on research pursued by members of the Columbia University community.  A key aspect of this course will be to confront students' preconceived notions of where a science education leads by promoting interaction with role models from science backgrounds who have pursued a variety of professions."

Murphy is awarded an NSF Astronomy and Astrophysics Postdoctoral Fellowship to carry out a program of research and education at Princeton University.  The current cosmological paradigm includes a significant and unknown physical entity called ""dark matter.""  While the presence of dark matter (DM) in galaxies is well established, the extent of galaxy DM halos and the role DM plays in galaxy formation and evolution is largely unknown.  As the current cosmological paradigm governing the hierarchical clustering of DM halos makes specific predictions about their formation timescales and merger history, a clear understanding of the mass of DM halos on galaxy scales is needed.  In this project the fellow will focus on directly constraining the mechanisms and timescales of elliptical galaxy formation.  <br/><br/>The recent discovery of quiescent, red elliptical galaxies at redshift around z~2 raises many questions regarding the Lambda Cold Dark Matter hierarchical picture of galaxy formation.  Fortunately, galaxies leave both chemical and kinematic clues to their formation histories.  Advances in integral field spectroscopy and dynamical modeling have begun to open the window into understanding the DM distribution, DM central density, the stellar orbital anisotropy and chemical abundance gradients of elliptical galaxies.  In this project the fellow will continue his study of the formation and evolution of massive elliptical galaxies.  Specifically, this project has the following aims: (1) The fellow will use 2D stellar kinematics from VIRUS-P and orbit-based, axisymmetric dynamical modeling to constrain the DM halo mass, the DM central density, the stellar orbital anisotropy and stellar abundance gradients.  From this he will be able to place direct constraints on the timescales and possible mechanisms of galaxy formation.  (2) The fellow will compare mass estimates based on stellar kinematics to other methods of estimating mass in galaxies in order to quantify any systematics between these different methods.  (3) The fellow will bring his experience with the commissioning of the VIRUS-P spectrograph, and his detailed study of the instrument's fiber optics, in order to successfully install a duplicate instrument on the DuPont telescope at Las Campanas Observatory.  He will then use this instrument to expand his current galaxy sample into the Southern Hemisphere.<br/><br/>The broader impacts of this project include a significant educational component.  The fellow will develop and teach a new course for the Prison Teaching Initiative (PTI).  The PTI program teaches college-credit courses to inmates at two youth correctional facilities near Princeton University.  The students can earn a two-year degree through the program and go onto four-year colleges upon release.  The course will focus on physics and astronomy and aim to develop both a scientific approach to problem solving and an appreciation of the practical application of science in daily life.  The large majority of evidence indicates that improving education in a prison population is the leading cause in reducing a return to crime upon release.  The fellow will bring his previous teaching skills and enthusiasm for science to a deserving, underrepresented population."

A longstanding problem in astrophysics is to understand how galaxies form.  Such understanding is necessary to uncover how our Universe evolved and to gain insight into the origin of our own Milky Way Galaxy.  One important aspect of understanding galaxy formation is to study how satellite galaxies relate to the dark matter subhalos in which they reside.  Uncovering this connection provides a wealth of information about galaxy formation and hierarchical structure formation in the Universe.  Satellite galaxies lead chaotic lives, yet an understanding of their spatial distribution gives clues into the relationship between the light and dark sides of the Universe. <br/><br/>In this project the fellow will focus on two principal aspects of galaxy formation theory that seek to shed light on the fate of satellite galaxies:  First, there is a strong luminosity trend of the radial density profile of satellite galaxies such that bright satellites are poor tracers of the dominant, underlying dark matter.  However, what is physically responsible for driving this result remains unclear.  The fellow will seek to incorporate high resolution dark matter N-body simulations that will be able to resolve subhalos down to the very small scales of interest.  Since satellite galaxies are believed to reside within subhalos, a detailed investigation of the spatial distribution of subhalos is crucial towards testing the concordance Lambda Cold Dark Matter model at the extreme small scales.  Second, the fellow will investigate a new technique to use the spatial clustering of satellite galaxies to understand how their stellar mass loss occurs.  Understanding how satellite galaxies can lose stellar mass can yield direct predictions for the amount of diffuse intrahalo light (IHL) at varying scales and may prove invaluable for providing insight into the physics of galaxy formation.<br/><br/>The broader impacts of this project include a significant educational component.  One way to invigorate the general public and the next generation of great scientists is for astronomers to convey complex ideas with inspiration and clarity.  The fellow will take a two-part approach to this endeavor: (1) improving public outreach efforts at the Adler Planetarium, and (2) training K-12 Chicago public school teachers in acquiring the skills to effectively teach science (astronomy in particular) to underserved, minority students.  The first part involves the fellow developing new visualizations and engaging narratives for use in interactive presentations with museum visitors at the Adler Planetarium in Chicago.  In the second part the fellow will help to construct and implement a new professional development workshop for teachers with a focus on astronomy.  The experience with the Adler presentations will help inform the fellow on effective methods for taking astronomy into the classroom.  The teaching workshop will not only allow teachers direct exposure to real scientists and the scientific method, but it will also assess the ability of astronomers to galvanize the underserved youth to pursue career paths in science.  This activity will help enable teachers to inspire students to pursue careers in science."

This project is focused on understanding the physical and compositional properties of asteroids as they pass by Earth at very small distances.  The fellow will explore an area of planetary science that has only recently been enabled by the rapid rate of new near-Earth asteroid (NEO) discoveries.  This will not only have wide implications for understanding the compositional and physical properties of NEOs but will also be relevant to multidisciplinary studies involving the topics of impact hazards, meteoritics and cosmochemistry, space craft missions, radar astronomy, and Solar System dynamics.<br/><br/>With steadily increasing numbers of catalogued NEOs, investigators are reaching a point where close encounters with Earth are no longer detected just a few days beforehand but can be predicted months or years in advance.  During close encounters small bodies in unexplored size regimes become observationally accessible across a wide range of wavelengths and with a variety of ground-based facilities.  The fellow will take advantage of these encounters by conducting targeted spectroscopic and photometric campaigns in each year of his fellowship.  These observations will (1) provide insight on the compositional properties of small asteroids, (2) establish links between meteorites on Earth and their immediate parent bodies in space, (3) investigate the role of observing geometry on reflectance measurements of planetary bodies, and (4) look for asteroid surface heterogeneity which could provide clues about regolith and thermo-physical properties.<br/><br/>The broader impacts of this project include a significant educational component.  The fellow's educational plan involves a combination of mentoring, curriculum development, and teaching, all focused on training undergraduates in innovative ways on the foundations of observational astronomy.  The fellow will mentor several undergraduates over the course of the fellowship in a structured manner using inquiry-based methods.  By the second year the fellow will have developed a set of lessons and exercises that he will incorporate and teach in an observational astronomy course.  The program is designed to not only advance the learning and understanding of undergraduates through personalized mentoring and real research projects, but it will also incorporate new components into MIT?s observational astronomy course.

Differences in fundamental physics lead to changes in the large-scale clustering of matter, so one can use the universe as a particle physics laboratory by measuring this clustering with surveys cataloging large numbers of galaxies. However, galaxy formation physics also impacts the clustering, which leads to systematic uncertainties in measuring dark energy and neutrino properties. This project will develop a detailed understanding of these uncertainties and apply them to the upcoming generation of galaxy surveys. The methods used will be as follows: first, build theoretical models encoding galaxy formation physics and test them by comparing to current surveys and simulations. Next, use these models to compute the uncertainties expected from future galaxy surveys. Finally, develop analysis methods to apply to future survey data that will optimize the physics results. The primary objective is an analytical framework to account for galaxy formation physics when extracting information about dark energy and neutrinos from survey data.<br/><br/>Dr. Swanson will also develop and teach an enrichment course in cosmology for Boston area high-school students through the Massachusetts Institute of Technology Educational Studies Program.

Open star clusters, whose ages and distances can be reliably determined, have long been used to probe the chemical evolution of the Milky Way disk. Until now, open cluster chemical abundance studies have focused on iron and the light and alpha-elements, and the exact nature of the transition from the inner disk to the outer disk and of the outer disk itself is still unclear. Dr. Jacobson will determine detailed abundances of s- and r-process elements via high-resolution spectroscopy for a large sample of open clusters in the Milky Way disk, with emphasis on clusters in the transition region and in the outer disk. S- and r-process elements such as barium and europium are formed via neutron-capture on to iron-peak nuclei inside low-mass evolved asymptotic-giant-branch stars or in Type II supernovae. The abundance distributions of these elements, along with those previously studied, will provide more clues to the chemical enrichment history of the Galaxy at different locations in the disk, and whether or not the outer disk has a distinct evolutionary history than the inner disk.<br/><br/>Dr. Jacobson will also design a new introductory astronomy class for non-science majors based upon the ""Astronomy Picture of the Day"" website and other material geared towards the general public. A significant component to the course will be to read and discuss how course topics are represented by the news media to the general public. The goals of the course are not only to improve students' knowledge of astronomy, but to make them scientifically literate so they can read and identify where science articles may be correct, incomplete or misleading. The ultimate goal will be to give future leaders and policy-makers the scientific background and tools they need to make informed decisions about science education and policy."

These data will provide further constraints on how giant galaxies are formed.  She will also compare her wide-field optical images with space-based X-ray data to explore the connection between GCs and X-ray emission from discrete sources in normal galaxies. <br/><br/>In addition to her research, Dr. Rhode will develop laboratory exercises, aimed at non-science-majors in undergraduate astronomy courses, that involve observing with a small telescope and Charge Coupled Device (CCD) cameras. These labs will provide students first-hand experience with the tools used in modern astronomy. After being tested and refined, the labs will be disseminated to the community via a web site and presented at a meeting of the American Astronomical Society. <br/>***"

The cause of these highly focused outflows are thought to be accretion disks around central objects, but are not well understood.  Dr. Sokoloski will conduct a detailed study of accretion disks around symbiotic stars, in which a white dwarf star accretes gas from the stellar wind of a red giant. The three facets of the research project will be (1) an archival spectroscopic survey for jets in symbiotic stars, plus complementary radio, optical, and X-ray imaging observations; (2) an exploration of the disk-jet connection in symbiotic stars, including interferometric observations that could possibly produce the first image of a tidally distorted star; and (3) a detailed examination of the jet-producing inner-disk region in selected white-dwarf accretors. The goal is to use the symbiotic stars to distinguish between competing jet models, both for these systems and for astrophysical jets generally. <br/><br/>Dr. Sokoloski will also work towards increasing the participation of women and girls in science. She will continue to participate in the ""Eyes to the Future"" science mentorship program for middle-school girls, and focus on recruiting colleagues to participate as well.

Studying dark matter halo structure and substructure leads to profound connections among these fields.

One of the most outstanding problems of modern cosmology is the identification of the reionizing energy source of the universe. The simplest explanation posits that stars in first-light galaxies comprise this ionizing source. Although these stars should leave a distinctive spectral and spatial signature on the cosmic Near Infrared Background (NIRB), to date no such detection exists, primarily because of uncertainties in the modeling of light scattered off of interplanetary dust (zodiacal light). To detect this NIRB signature of the first-light galaxies, Dr. Renbarger and his colleagues will build the Cosmic Infrared Background ExploRer (CIBER). CIBER is a rocket-borne suite of four telescopes that will perform imaging and spectroscopy of the NIRB in addition to directly imaging the intensity of zodiacal light. The direct zodiacal measurement will eliminate the need to rely on modeling of the zodiacal intensity and will thus eliminate the dominant source of systematic uncertainty in cosmic NIRB measurements. Over the next three years Dr. Renbarger will direct the design, fabrication and testing of the zodiacal imaging system and lead the payload integration in the lab and the field.<br/><br/>Dr. Renbarger will also develop and annually teach an academic enrichment course designed for high school students held during the summer on the UCSD campus. This project-oriented course will involve the launch of a scaled-down version of the CIBER payload with the experimental objective of measuring atmospheric temperature and humidity vs. altitude. By means of this course, Dr. Renbarger will give his students a taste of the exciting world of rocket science. Building on previous public outreach experiences while stationed at the South Pole, Dr. Renbarger will also maintain a weblog in which he will report on lab progress and the CIBER launch campaign.

However, a fundamental problem is the lack of dwarf spheroidal (dSph) galaxies having similar metallicity distribution functions (MDF) as the halo.<br/><br/>Dr. Lai will study outer-halo VMP stars and search for these unique abundance patterns by capitalizing on resources newly available for this work: a large, spectroscopically selected sample of VMP candidates from the Sloan Extension for Galactic Understanding and Exploration (SEGUE) survey, and abundance analyses using efficient spectroscopy on the Echellette Spectrograph and Imager (ESI) instrument at Keck Observatory.

Dr. Murphy will complete development of BETHE, a multi-angle, multi-energy-group, multidimensional, time-dependent radiation-hydrodynamics code. Radiation hydrodynamics is a core subject in astrophysics, and for many phenomena asphericities either accompany or are fundamental to the underlying theory. BETHE uses novel mixed-frame radiation transport that is straightforward to implement, generalizable to multiple dimensions, accurate and relatively fast. The hydrodynamics solver is an Arbitrary Lagrangian-Eulerian (ALE) method and uses arbitrary grids providing flexibility to tailor the grid to the computational challenge. Together, these characteristics allow for unique multidimensional simulations of astrophysical phenomena. In particular, Dr. Murphy will (1) address the viability of the neutrino and acoustic mechanisms for core-collapse supernovae, (2) simulate winds from oblate hot stars, and (3) investigate whether proposed mechanisms for luminous-blue-variable outbursts can reproduce, in the context of rapidly rotating stars, the observations of Eta Carinae's Homunculus.<br/><br/>Dr. Murphy will also be actively involved with the Pre-Major in Astronomy Program (Pre-MAP), which seeks to retain a diverse student body in the University of Washington Astronomy Department.

Yet, a new understanding of Titan's weather and methane meteorological cycle is only just starting to develop and will require a variety of new observing techniques and strategies. High resolution adaptive optics images with large telescopes (Keck, Gemini, Palomar) show the locations, sizes, and morphologies of the clouds. Observing Titan's clouds with a variety of strategies on these telescopes will answer the many questions concerning spatial, lifetime, and size distributions of the clouds. Dr. Roe will employ a robotic 24"" telescope equipped with CCD and custom filters to monitor total cloud coverage and to place the high resolution data in context as well as to trigger target-of-opportunity observations of extreme events. Dr. Roe will also map methane humidity using a new high spatial/spectral resolution technique that will reveal the global circulation pattern as well as show local features such as weather fronts.

However, few core-collapse supernova remnants show evidence for a neutron star, and these neutron stars are often very different from radio pulsars.
